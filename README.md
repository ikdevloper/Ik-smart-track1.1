✨ Key Features
Enhanced Integration
Automatic sync: Every transaction instantly saves to Google Sheets

Manual sync: Pull latest data from sheets with one click

Data Management
The script creates two sheets automatically:

Transactions Sheet:

ID, Type, Amount, Category, Description, Date, Timestamp

Color-coded headers

Auto-resized columns

Goals Sheet:

ID, Name, Target Amount, Type, Current Progress, Timestamp

Formatted for easy reading

User Experience

Filter transactions by multiple criteria

Mobile-responsive design

Local storage as backup

Clear success/error alerts

🔒 Security & Privacy
Your data stays in your Google Sheet

Web app runs locally in your browser

No third-party servers involved

You control all access permissions

📊 How It Works
Web App → Google Sheets (Automatic)
When you add/edit/delete a transaction:

Data saves to local storage

HTTP POST request sent to Apps Script

Apps Script receives JSON data

Data written to appropriate Google Sheet

Confirmation returned to web app

Google Sheets → Web App (Manual)
When you click "Sync Now":

HTTP GET request to Apps Script

Script reads all data from sheets

Returns JSON with transactions and goals

Web app updates display and local storage

🛠️ Technical Implementation
The solution uses:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript

Backend: Google Apps Script (JavaScript)

API: RESTful endpoints (doGet/doPost)

Data Format: JSON for communication
